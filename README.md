# Cloud-Adoption-Drivers-Analysis

This project analyzes **why enterprises adopt cloud services** and generates a **visual HTML report** that summarizes key drivers (such as cost efficiency, scalability, security, etc.) with their relative importance and explanations.

The report includes:
- A **pie chart visualization** of cloud adoption drivers  
- A **ranked table** with short explanations for each factor  
- **Recommendations** for enterprises planning cloud migration  

---
## 📄 Overview

This project generates an interactive HTML report that visualizes and explains the key drivers behind enterprise cloud adoption.
It uses Python and Matplotlib to create a clean pie chart and structured report showing the relative importance and explanation of each cloud adoption factor.

The tool helps IT teams, students, or professionals easily understand what motivates organizations to move to the cloud — such as cost efficiency, scalability, agility, security, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives

To analyze and visualize the main drivers for cloud adoption in enterprises.

To provide a weighted comparison of each driver’s importance.

To generate a beautiful HTML report that includes:

Pie chart visualization

Ranked driver table

Explanations and recommendations

## ⚙️ Features

📊 Pie Chart Visualization — Displays the relative weight of each driver.

🧾 Ranked Table View — Lists all drivers, weights, percentages, and short explanations.

💡 Actionable Recommendations — Suggests next steps for cloud adoption planning.

🖥️ Automatic HTML Report Generation — The program creates and opens the report directly in your browser.

✏️ Editable Data — You can easily change driver names or weights in the Python file.

## 🌐 Relation to SDG Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
This project supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 9, which focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.
By analyzing and visualizing key cloud adoption drivers, this project highlights how cloud computing enables modern industries to grow more efficiently and sustainably.
Cloud adoption helps organizations:


🏗 Build resilient digital infrastructure that supports continuous operations, disaster recovery, and global availability.


💡 Promote innovation by giving access to advanced technologies like AI, ML, and analytics through cloud services.


⚙️ Enhance industrial efficiency by improving scalability, reducing IT costs, and speeding up development processes.


🌱 Encourage sustainable technology use — the cloud optimizes resource utilization, reducing energy waste compared to on-premise data centers.


🤝 Enable digital transformation for small and large enterprises, leading to smarter, data-driven decision-making and inclusive industrial growth.


In summary, this project demonstrates how understanding and prioritizing cloud adoption drivers contributes to sustainable, innovative, and efficient digital infrastructure, directly aligning with SDG Goal 9.
