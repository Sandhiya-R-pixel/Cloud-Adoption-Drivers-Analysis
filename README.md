# Cloud-Adoption-Drivers-Analysis

This project analyzes **why enterprises adopt cloud services** and generates a **visual HTML report** that summarizes key drivers (such as cost efficiency, scalability, security, etc.) with their relative importance and explanations.

The report includes:
- A **pie chart visualization** of cloud adoption drivers  
- A **ranked table** with short explanations for each factor  
- **Recommendations** for enterprises planning cloud migration
